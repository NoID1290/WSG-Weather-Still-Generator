## Overview

The OpenMap library is developed by NoID Softwork and is licensed under the MIT License. However, this library uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) tile services and map data, which have their own licensing requirements that you **MUST** comply with.

## OpenMap Library License

**Copyright (c) 2026 NoID Softwork**

This library (OpenMap) is licensed under the MIT License. See the main [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file in the project root for details.

## OpenStreetMap Data License

### Data License: ODbL

OpenStreetMap data is licensed under the **Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)** by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).

- **License**: [ODbL 1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/)
- **Copyright**: © OpenStreetMap contributors
- **License URL**: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright

### Your Rights and Obligations

You are free to:
- Copy, distribute, transmit and adapt OSM data
- Use the map tiles in your applications

You MUST:
- **Credit OpenStreetMap contributors** with proper attribution (see below)
- If you alter or build upon OSM data, distribute the result only under the same ODbL license
- Make it clear that the data is available under the Open Database License

## Required Attribution

### How to Attribute OpenStreetMap

When displaying maps generated by this library, you **MUST** display the following attribution:

```
© OpenStreetMap contributors
```

The attribution must:
- Be **clearly visible** on the map (typically in the bottom-right or bottom-left corner)
- Include a **hyperlink** to https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright (for digital displays)
- **NOT** be hidden behind UI elements, toggles, or off-screen
- Be present on **every** map display (images, videos, applications)

### Attribution Examples

**For Web Applications:**
```html
<div style="position: absolute; bottom: 5px; right: 5px; font-size: 10px; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.7); padding: 2px 5px;">
  © <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap contributors</a>
</div>
```

**For Static Images:**
Add text overlay: `© OpenStreetMap contributors | https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright`

**For Printed Materials:**
Include the full text: "© OpenStreetMap contributors. Data available under the Open Database License. https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright"

**For Video Content:**
Display attribution throughout the video (corner overlay) or in credits.

## OSM Tile Usage Policy Compliance

This library uses the OpenStreetMap tile servers at `tile.openstreetmap.org`. You **MUST** comply with the [OSM Tile Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/).

### Key Requirements

✅ **You MUST:**
- Use HTTPS URL: `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
- Provide visible license attribution (see above)
- Send a valid HTTP User-Agent identifying your application (this library handles this)
- Cache tiles locally according to HTTP caching headers (minimum 7 days)
- Avoid encouraging or enabling copyright infringement

❌ **You MUST NOT:**
- Bulk download ("scrape") tiles or prefetch large areas
- Offer "download for offline use" features
- Send `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers
- Bypass tile caching mechanisms
- Impersonate another application's User-Agent

### Technical Compliance

This library is configured to comply with OSM technical requirements:
- **User-Agent**: Set to `WeatherImageGenerator/1.0 (+https://github.com/NoID-Softwork/weather-still-api)`
- **Tile Caching**: Implements local caching with 7-day minimum TTL
- **HTTPS**: Uses secure HTTPS connections only
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents bulk downloads with reasonable request patterns

### What This Library Allows

✅ **Permitted Use Cases:**
- Interactive map viewing where users actively browse
- Generating map backgrounds for weather displays at viewed locations
- Creating static images with maps for specific locations
- Video generation with map backgrounds for specific locations
- Re-displaying cached tiles (honors 7-day minimum cache)

❌ **Prohibited Use Cases:**
- Pre-downloading entire cities, regions, or countries
- "Download for offline use" features
- Creating tile archives (`.mbtiles`, `.zip`) for distribution
- Automated scanning of large areas
- Any form of tile prefetching beyond immediate user needs

## Alternative Tile Providers

If OSM tile servers don't meet your needs (e.g., you need offline support, higher usage limits, or commercial guarantees), consider:

### Free Alternatives
- **OpenTopoMap**: Topographic map style (already supported in this library)
- **ESRI Satellite**: Satellite imagery (already supported in this library)
- **Mapbox Free Tier**: Requires API key, 50,000 requests/month free
- **Thunderforest**: Various styles, free tier available

### Self-Hosting
- Download OSM data and render your own tiles
- Guide: https://switch2osm.org/

### Commercial Providers
- Mapbox (paid plans)
- Maptiler
- HERE Maps
- Google Maps Platform
- See: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Commercial_OSM_Software_and_Services
